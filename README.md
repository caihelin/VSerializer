# VSerializer
A library to serialize and deserialize objects with minimum memory usage.

# Motivation

Memory on Android is precious. Every application should be using the minimum available memory both volatile and persistent.
However, the complexity of doing such a thing is too much for the average developer that wants to ship the application as 
fast as possible. The aim of this library is to automate the whole process and replace ideally the default serialization mechanism.


# How does it work?

This project is under development and very young. However, you can use it if you are curious or you want to be a step ahead by 
following the examples in the unit test classes.
